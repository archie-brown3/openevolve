"""
Seed program for the cache-replacement-policy evolution experiment.

OpenEvolve mutates only the score() function inside the EVOLVE-BLOCK.
benchmark.py provides the simulation harness — this file must define
ONLY score() (no simulate(), no imports, no other functions).

score() return value: higher = more valuable = keep in cache.
The cache evicts the resident with the LOWEST score.
Seed -recency reproduces LRU exactly.
